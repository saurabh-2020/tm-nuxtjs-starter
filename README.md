This is my minimal yet functional Vue starter kit and demo app as of
August 2018.

If you feel tired of Javascript fatigue, and want to get started quick and
easy, take a peek of this.  Developing a modern Vue app does not get
much simpler than this.

The demo app is a static site, a basic single-page-app that has a few
addressable pages that are lazy loaded on-demand. It demonstrates basic CRUD
operations: 1) list movies, 2) view movie details, 3) create/edit and 4)
delete a movie.

The demo uses browser localStorage for the data storage, which means it runs
without a backend.  The sources do contain a module that does real AJAX calls
to a REST backend - you just need to enable the module and write a server,
and you are in good track to have a real web app.
